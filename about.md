The Gordon Lab focuses on a systems-level understanding of the genome.

The interactions between molecular species of the genome are difficult to observe, yet they are the drivers of patterns within the genome.  

Check out our research projects for more details, but examples of general questions we address include:

* High throughput pan-genomics of eukaryotic species for unbiased analysis of intra-species diversity.
* Allopolyploid dissection for a systems-level understanding of the genome.
* Comparative genomics for studying annual/perennial life history strategy transitions.

Gordon Lab research is driven by biological questions but our approach is quantitative, including applied statistics, dynamical systems, simulations, and machine learning.
Members of the Gordon Lab develop data-driven, quantitative approaches customized to a wide range of biological problems in natural and agricultural systems.
